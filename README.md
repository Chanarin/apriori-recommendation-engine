# ARERA - Apriori Recommendation Engine RESTful API

An apriori-algorithm-based recommendation engine API build with Laravel/Lumen &amp; Redis.

## Purpose

Provide developers an easy way to integrate a simple, powerful, and extremely fast recommendation engine into their applications.

## Some Common Use Cases:

**E-commerce:** Recommend what other users also viewed, purchased, put in their cart/wish list, etc. <br />

**Search:** Help predict possible words to be typed depending on the combinations of words entered.  <br />

**Items Location Optimization**: Optimize items location based on their association rules. Applies for stores or distribution centers. <br />

## Notice:

I recently began this project. I haven't gotten the time to write a more complete documentation on what it is trying to do. However, I think the code is somewhat readable, intuitive, and easy to understand. I encourage everyone interested to give me their opionions and to contribute. I will do my best to document this project over the next few days, and to promote it around developers to see if it can get some traction. Thanks in advance and I hope to see some pull requests soon.

## Contributing 

Find an area you can help with and do it. Open source is about collaboration and open participation. Try to make your code look like what already exists or better and submit a pull request. Also, in general if you have any ideas on how to make the code better or on improving its scope and functionality please contact me.
